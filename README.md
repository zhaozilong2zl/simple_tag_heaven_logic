**task description**:


Based on the VMAS simple_tag code, write code to implement the following logic: after an adversary and an agent collide,
both go to "heaven", which means they each receive a large one-time reward or penalty after the collision, 
then "exit" the environment, i.e., they no longer take actions, are fixed at the heaven position, and their observations (observing others and being observed by others) are all zero.

if you want to try this task, please put simple_tag_heaven.py to your local site-packages/vmas/scenarios/mpe, and follow https://github.com/facebookresearch/BenchMARL/tree/main/examples/extending/task
 to add this new vmas task.
